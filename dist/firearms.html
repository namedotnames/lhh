  <h3>In the wake of every mass shooting in America comes the debate over gun control. </h3>
  <p>Amid the loud refrains for and against reform, one vital statistic tunelessly whistles, unheard: the majority of gun deaths are not homicides. They're suicides.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center"><div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/656779"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></p>
  <p style="text-align: center"></p><p style=" font-size:0.6rem; margin: 0"><caption>The largest percentage jump for both homicides and suicides with a firearm occurred between 2014 and 2016.</caption></p><p></p>
  <p>This invisible data falls victim to the stigma surrounding killing oneself. "Culturally and historically, suicide has always come with a high level of shame and embarrassment," according to Lisa Gold, Georgetown University Professor of Psychiatry. </p>
  <p>Only 23 percent of Americans said suicide was the leading cause of gun death, according to a July poll by APM Research Labs.</p>

      </p><h2>Access Matters</h2>
      <p>Having access to a firearm when suicidal greatly impacts whether the attempt's outcome will be fatal or not. Over 80 percent of suicide attempts involving a gun ended up in death, significantly above other methods, according to a 2001 poll by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>The western United States contain a region dubbed the "suicide belt" because the rate of suicides in those states are much higher than the national average. These communitites are legislatively gun-friendly. One-third of the states that comprise the region allow permitless handgun possession, also known as "constitutional carry." </p>
      <p>According to a 2011 report by the University of Nevada, the belt is comprised of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Utah, as well as two of the three states with the highest suicide rates: Montana and Wyoming. (Alaska falls into that same statistical set, but is separated by geography.)</p>

    <h2>The Vulnerable</h2>
    <p> Due to a propensity towards mental health issues and familiarity with guns, veterans tend to overwhelmingly choose a firearm to commit suicide.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/656779"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></p>
    <p>In a year when the NYPD's suicide rate has already reached twice its anual average, police officers should also be addressing this issue. According to one 2018 study by the Ruderman Family, more law enforcement officers die by suicide than in the line of duty, and estimates that 90 percent of police officers who die by suicide use a firearm.  </p>
