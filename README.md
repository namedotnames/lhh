<b>Guns in America</b>

This is a look at the Multiple Cause of Death data from the CDC. It is county-level national mortality and population data spanning the years 1999-2017. The data comes from death certificates filed in the U.S. of residents, and shows that there are more gun deaths as the result of suicide than homicide.

Also included is data from the Department of Veterans Affairs. It shows that a large majority of veterans commit suicide with a firearm.
