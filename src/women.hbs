   <p><h3>In spite of being a well-known problem, the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) remain battlefields for women.</h3></p>
   <p style="font-size:1.2rem">One sign of hope is that more women are choosing to get an education in these fields. This fun graph shows that since 2016, the majority of U.S. medical students have been female.</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.2rem">But consider the data without the bells and whistles.</p>
   <p style="font-size:1.2rem">Dubbed a scissor graph, this shows a trend that women are eager to enter the medical field, despite their current minority representation in the public, academic, and private sectors.</p>

   <p style="font-size:1.2rem">Yet almost ironically, within the world of women in STEM, referencing “scissor graphs” or “scissor diagrams” is shorthand for the wide gap between their careers and those of their male counterparts.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.2rem">While female enrollment and admission for tertiary education is up, those numbers drop precipitously over the course of getting advanced degrees and being hired as a researcher in their field. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, only 29% of researchers globally are women. The drastically diminishing number of women scientists who complete a Doctoral program or equivalent show that–despite all of their work up until then–they instead leave behind a pool of majority-male colleagues.</p>
